\section*{Highlights}

With 50\% of the samples collected at Everglades National Park now analyzed, we can share the following highlights: \SI{17.5}{\litre} of water, roughly two buckets, contained:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{12,458 unique sequences}
\item DNA from \textbf{163 identifiable species} of which 45 species were not previously reported in the Everglades. The Everglades is home to over 2,500 marine species (source UNESCO/Ocean Biodiversity Information System OBIS).
\item DNA of the following IUCN Red List \textbf{threatened species}: Sphyrna tiburo (bonnethead shark, EN), Limulus polyphemus (horseshoe crab, VU), Negaprion brevirostris (lemon shark, VU), Trichechus manatus (West Indian manatee, VU), Megalops atlanticus (tarpon, VU), Epinephelus itajara (Atlantic goliath grouper, VU), Caretta caretta (loggerhead sea turtle, VU).
\end{itemize}

\section*{What is the eDNA Expeditions project?}

\begin{multicols}{2}
eDNA Expeditions is a global, citizen science initiative that will measure marine biodiversity and predict the impact climate change will have on marine community composition across UNESCO World Heritage marine sites.

eDNA or environmental DNA is a cost effective and minimally invasive method to measure biodiversity in any given area. Marine species continuously shed DNA into the water around them in the form of waste, mucus, or cells. By collecting this DNA from water samples, and subsequently amplifying and sequencing specific regions within these DNA strands, we can detect a wide variety of species without removing any organisms from their environment. The amplified regions are selected depending on the scope of the study: while some markers are suitable to obtain a broad overview of biodiversity across many groups of species, other markers are particularly suited get high resolution insight for a more specific taxonomic group. The eDNA Expeditions project combines a number of markers tailored for marine vertebrates (fish, mammals, and turtles), and a marker which allows us to cast a wider net and also detect some species from other groups such as invertebrates.

Between September 2022 and May 2023, the eDNA Expeditions project organized eDNA sampling campaigns in 21 marine World Heritage sites around the world. At every site, around 20 samples are collected from different habitats by teams of citizen scientists and local staff. Biodiversity inventories generated from these samples will be combined with existing species distribution data from public biodiversity databases such as the Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS) to get a comprehensive overview of marine life at the sites. Using climate scenarios and species distribution models, we will estimate the impact of rising temperatures on local biodiversity.

\section*{Results}
\subsection*{Sampling and sample processing}

\begin{multicols}{2}
eDNA sampling was conducted in Everglades National Park in April 2023, by filtering up to \SI{1800}{\milli\litre} of seawater through filter cartridges with a \SI{0.8}{\micro\metre} pore size. 20 samples were collected at five locations in the park: Trout Creek, North Eagle Creek, Crocodile Dragover, Whip Ray, and Captain. After sampling, the filter cartridges were flushed with preservation liquid and shipped to the OBIS secretariat in Belgium. From these 20 samples, a first batch of 11 samples covering all sites has now (November 2023) been processed. A second batch of samples will be processed before the end of the year. DNA from these samples was extracted and amplified, and then sent to the sequencing facility at KU Leuven in Belgium. PCR amplification was done using five primer pairs selected to capture as much biodiversity as possible in the target groups of the study: fish, mammals, and turtles.
\end{multicols}

\subsection*{DNA sequencing}

\begin{multicols}{2}
Sequencing of the DNA from 11 samples resulted in over 20 million sequence reads. From these reads we were able to collect 12,458 unique sequences or ASVs. Matching those sequences with reference sequences in public databases, we were able to detect 163 species. Most of these species are vertebrates, but we also detected species from other groups including arthropods, cnidarians, echinoderms, molluscs, and sponges (Figure \ref{fig:tree}). Of the 163 species detected, 45 are not among the 2,566 species previously reported from Everglades National Park to the OBIS database.

\subsection*{Species identification}

\begin{multicols}{2}
The marker sequences obtained from sequencing were matched with sequence reference databases built using public data available from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). This resulted in the identification of 163 species, of which 86 fish species, two mammalian species, and one turtle species (Table \ref{table:groups}). This represents about one sixth of the species known from Everglades National Park in the OBIS database. Seven of the detected species are listed as threatened on the IUCN Red List (Table \ref{table:categories}). A full list of species is added at the end of this report.
